To do:
- Add oscillator component to kernels, which contains necessary info for filon quadrature
- create mesh quadrature points + weights output
- add to integrator data file which stores previous kernel values, weights and nodes
- Define Herglotz-type incidence
- Change uinc for non-integrals to output BoundaryFunction file for traces

Bug symptoms:
- solution multiplied by -1 (only) in case where source point is above scatterer
- HNA screen code doesn't work, not even close
