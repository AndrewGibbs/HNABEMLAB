HNABEMLAB

Fast solver for high frequency scattering problems in 2-dimensions. Uses collocation BEM with an Hybrid Numerical Asymptotic (HNA) method, which absorbs oscillatory part of solution into approximation space.

Requires PathFinder (available from https://github.com/AndrewGibbs/NSDpackage) to be on Matlab search path
